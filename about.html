            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Apex064, a web developer and tech enthusiast with a deep passion for building powerful and user-friendly digital experiences. Over the last five years, I've honed my skills in both web development and programming, creating everything from beautiful websites to automated systems and AI-based applications.

My journey began with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I first discovered the art of creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. As I grew more comfortable in the world of front-end development, I expanded my skill set to include back-end programming with Node.js and Python, which has allowed me to create full-stack applications and dynamic websites.

One of my key strengths is my ability to adapt and work with a variety of technologies. From crafting responsive, cross-browser compatible websites to diving deep into Python for automation, machine learning, and data analysis, I thrive in environments where I can learn new tools and solve complex problems. I’m also well-versed in using Git for version control, which allows me to collaborate smoothly with teams and manage codebases efficiently.

Here are a few of the skills and technologies I’ve mastered:

Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js

Backend Programming: Python, Flask, Django

Responsive Web Design: Bootstrap, CSS Flexbox, Grid Layout

Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab

UI/UX Design: Wireframing, prototyping, Adobe XD, Figma

Automation & Scripting: Python scripts for automation, data collection, and AI-based tasks

Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

What drives me the most is the ability to combine creativity with problem-solving, whether I’m designing intuitive user interfaces or writing code to automate tasks that improve efficiency. I believe in building solutions that not only look great but are also highly functional and scalable.

As I continue my journey in the tech world, I’m always looking for new challenges to tackle, new technologies to master, and ways to make an impact in the digital world. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects that blend technology with my passion for AI and automation.

If you’re looking for someone who can bring innovative ideas to life and deliver exceptional digital products, feel free to reach out—I’d love to collaborate!
